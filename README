This is the second prototype for Mango Studios' game for CS 361 Game Design (Spring 2016) with Prof. Tom Wexler at Oberlin College.

Hack and Slash games like Dynasty Warriors have been a popular style of game for many years. 
In those games you play a powerful hero that mows down wave after wave of smaller almost inconsequential baddies. \
In Power in Numbers we are reversing that formula. Here you are going to play one of those useless baddies in an attempt to 
defeat a foe much larger and more powerful than yourself.
